<p>To start the React project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Here are the steps to create a new React project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.</li>
<li>Run the command  <code>npx create-react-app my-app</code>  to create a new React project named “my-app”.</li>
<li>Navigate into the project directory by running  <code>cd my-app</code>.</li>
<li>Run the command  <code>npm start</code>  to start the development server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the development server is running, you can begin building out the functionality of the Guruji Astrologer website. The basic functionality of the site should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>User authentication: Users should be able to create an account and log in to access their account information and to consult with astrologers.</li>
<li>Astrologer profiles: Astrologers should have their own profiles with information about their qualifications, areas of expertise, and availability.</li>
<li>Consultation booking: Users should be able to book consultations with astrologers based on their availability and areas of expertise.</li>
<li>Payment processing: Users should be able to pay for consultations securely through the site.</li>
<li>Communication platform: Users and astrologers should be able to communicate through a messaging system or video call platform within the site.</li>
</ol>
